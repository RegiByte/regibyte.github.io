Hey there folks, today I want to share a really old article I wrote
originally on medium showing how to structure your reducers in redux without using
the nasty switch-case structure.

These days there are a lot of new state management libraries that are simpler to work with,
but redux still holds it's place as React's most popular state management library.

[Here is the link](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/redux-without-switch-cases-and-some-other-tips-6a3d27157da6)

Feel free to reach out to me on the original post, I'll try to answer all of your questions.
